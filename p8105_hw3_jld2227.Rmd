```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```
First, we'll begin by importing the dataset, cleaning the names to be more appropriate, and
focusing on the Overall Health topic (by filtering for this topic only in the BRFSS responses).
Responses are filtered to only include the 5 ordinal categories, Excellent, Very Good,
Good, Fair, Poor.
```{r data_import}
brfss <- p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% #Pulls dataframe out of package.
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  #Converts to snake case.
  filter(topic == "Overall Health",
         response %in% c("Excellent","Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>%     #Filters by overall health topic.
  mutate(response = factor(response,levels = c("Excellent","Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
  
  
```
Problem 2
```{r instacart_import}

```
